# Contextualised Embeddings for Lexical Semantic Change Detection
This code accompanies the paper `*UiO-UvA at SemEval-2020 Task 1: Contextualised Embeddings for Lexical Semantic Change Detection*',
which describes our participation in [SemEval 2020 Task 1: Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20948).

Some code is based on [LSCDetection repository](https://github.com/Garrafao/LSCDetection).

### Code

We provide implementations for the algorithms we used for the shared task.
